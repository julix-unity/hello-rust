These files represent my first hours of learning Rust, reaindg https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ and coding along to solidify my learning.
I come from a web background (React with TypeScript) so don't expect ideomatic Rust just yet.
Though https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/idioms/index.html is on my list of things to read next ^.^'
